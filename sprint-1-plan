# Sprint 1 Plan

## Sprint Duration
2 weeks

## Selected Stories
1. User can register
2. User can log in
3. User can log out
4. User can view food list

## Reason for Selection
I selected these four stories for Sprint 1 because they are high-priority, core requirements. 
User authentication and basic access to the food list are essential for the application to function. 
Scrum recommends selecting backlog items based on priority, and these features provide a strong foundation for future sprints.
